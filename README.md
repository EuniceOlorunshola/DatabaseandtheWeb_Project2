# Project2 

# Description about this project 
I did this project for my database and the web class as a graduate student 
It contains 4 parts on XML Schema, XQuery, and XSLT with subparts.
# XML Schema
  * (I) Gradebook

  Consider the XML document gradebook.xml. This document describes grade book data as kept by instructors of courses in a university.

  Write an XML Schema for the gradebook XML documents.

  * (II) Binary Tree

 Consider a sample binary-tree XML document in the binarytree.xml document, storing a set of decimal values

 Write an XML Schema for such XML documents.

# XQuery
  * (I) Drinks
  
Consider the XML document drinks.xml which records data about bars, beers, and drinkers in a local neighborhood. Write XQuery expressions to answer the following queries:

a. Find bars that serve a beer that Donald likes.

b. Find drinkers who frequent at least one bar that serves a beer they like.

c. Find drinkers who frequent at least all those bars that Donald frequents.

d. Find drinkers who frequent no bar that serves a beer they like.

e. Find drinkers who frequent only bars that serve at least one beer they like.
