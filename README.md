# Project2 

# Description about this project 
I did this project for my database and the web class as a graduate student 
It contains 4 parts on XML Schema, XQuery, and XSLT with subparts.
* XML Schema

(I) Gradebook

Consider the XML document gradebook.xml. This document describes grade book data as kept by instructors of courses in a university.

Write an XML Schema for the gradebook XML documents.

(II) Binary Tree

Consider a sample binary-tree XML document in the binarytree.xml document, storing a set of decimal values

Write an XML Schema for such XML documents.
